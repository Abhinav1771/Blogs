### 📌 Introduction: A Puzzle Beyond Logic

Imagine this: you take a solid sphere and cut it into a few parts. Then, by rotating and rearranging these parts — **without stretching or scaling anything** — you somehow get **two identical copies** of the original sphere.

Sounds impossible? That's the **Banach–Tarski Paradox**.

This paradox is not a trick or a joke — it’s a proven result in mathematics. It relies on abstract mathematical tools like **set theory**, **infinite groups**, and the **Axiom of Choice**. While it cannot be done physically, it shakes the foundation of how we understand space, volume, and logic.

This blog takes a deep dive into the paradox, including its intuition, proof ideas, logical foundation, **real-world significance**, **philosophical impact**, comparisons with other approaches, a new **logical explanation** from my perspective, **applications**, **equations**, and **proofs with diagrams**.

### 🧩 An Interactive Look: Can You Duplicate a Sphere?

Here’s a simple video to visualise sphere decomposition:

While this can't simulate non-measurable sets, it helps grasp the idea of splitting and reassembling spatial objects.

### 🔍 The Paradox Stated with Notation

Let B ⊆ ℝ³ be a solid ball. Then:

B = A₁ ∪ A₂ ∪ A₃ ∪ A₄ ∪ A₅

There exist rotations Rᵢ ∈ SO(3) such that:

R₁(A₁) ∪ R₂(A₂) = B,  R₃(A₃) ∪ R₄(A₄) ∪ R₅(A₅) = B

Clarification: SO(3) is the group of all 3×3 orthogonal matrices with determinant 1, representing pure rotations in 3D space.

---

## 🔬 How Is the Ball Partitioned into Non-Measurable Sets?

### 🧱 1. The Sphere as a Set of Points

A ball B ⊆ ℝ³ is the set of points within some radius. It contains infinitely many points.

It’s made of **points** — like glitter dots in 3D space.

* You can’t count them.
    
* You can’t measure them.
    
* But you can **label** them and move them.
    

### 🔁 2. Group Actions: Rotating the Sphere

Use a free group G = ⟨a, b⟩ ⊂ SO(3) acting on the ball. Elements of G rotate points within B.

A **group** is:

* A **set of actions**
    
* That you can **combine**
    
* And keep **doing it over and over**
    

### 🎯 3. Orbits and Equivalence Classes

Each point x ∈ B has an orbit:  
  Orb(x) = { g(x) | g ∈ G }

Two points are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via G. These orbits partition the ball.

To understand more clearly, pick **one dot** on the ball.

Use every rotation in the group on that dot.  
It will move to many different places.

> The set of all places it can reach = its **orbit**

Every dot on the ball has an orbit — maybe big, maybe small.

This lets us sort the dots into **families of where they can go**.

### 🧃 4. What Are Non-Measurable Sets?

Normally, if you cut a ball, the pieces have **volume**, like slices of cake.

But the Banach–Tarski paradox uses **super weird point collections**.

These:

* **Can’t be measured**
    
* Have no proper volume
    
* They are called **non-measurable sets**
    

You can’t say:

* “This part is 1/5th of the ball” — that logic **doesn’t work here**
    

“They are not slices with clean boundaries, but scattered point collections so irregular that volume no longer applies.”

### 🎲 Axiom of Choice: Picking One Point per Orbit

From each orbit, the Axiom of Choice allows us to pick one representative. This forms a set X ⊂ B, which is non-measurable. Pick **1 point per orbit** (using Axiom of Choice) → this is Set X.

### ⚙️ The Role of the Axiom of Choice

* Allows selection from countless orbits
    
* Enables the construction of non-measurable sets
    

Without it, Banach–Tarski can’t be proven.

### ⚠️ Why It Fails Physically

* Real objects have atoms — countable, measurable
    
* AC can't operate on atoms — hence, no duplication in real-world physics

### 🧠 My Contribution: Deterministic Orbit Encoding and Symbolic Partitioning

---

#### Let the unit ball B ⊂ ℝ³, and let G = ⟨a, b⟩ ⊂ SO(3) be a free subgroup of rotations. Let x₀ ∈ B be the centre.

Each element g ∈ G is a finite word over the alphabet {a, a⁻¹, b, b⁻¹}. For any point x ∈ B, define its symbolic code by:

Code(x) = shortest (then lex smallest) word g such that g(x₀) ≈ x under a defined epsilon precision

Since exact equality is uncomputable due to the continuous nature of ℝ³, we simulate using a finite-precision model. This makes the method implementable and testable.

We then define a colouring function φ: B → {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} by:

φ(x) = (length of Code(x)) mod 5 + 1

Let Aᵢ = {x ∈ B | φ(x) = i}

These symbolic sets A₁, ..., A₅ partition B. Now select five explicit group words g₁, ..., g₅ ∈ G such that:

g₁(A₁) ∪ g₂(A₂) = B, g₃(A₃) ∪ g₄(A₄) ∪ g₅(A₅) = B

This process defines a simulatable model of the Banach–Tarski structure: we track and manipulate symbolic tags, not physical or actual non-measurable sets. This enables implementations using finite automata or group traversal code.

## 🧬 Real-Life Analogies (Expanded)

#### 🧱 Infinite Lego Analogy

Imagine you have Lego bricks that can snap in infinitely many orientations. If you're allowed to rearrange infinitely many bricks using just rotations (not duplication or stretching), you can use a logic similar to Banach–Tarski.

#### 🧪 Gas Molecule Rearrangement

Let’s say you have a perfectly isolated chamber of gas molecules. The molecules are countless and randomly moving. If somehow, you could identify orbits of individual molecules under transformation rules (e.g., time-evolving rotations) and assign symbolic colourings to each orbit, then, with a rule-based rotation function, you could **rearrange** subsets of the molecules such that the resulting distributions mimic two chambers.

Although this isn't physically possible due to quantum and atomic limitations, the **conceptual framework** allows you to think about entropy, molecule symmetries, and even quantum field models differently.

It builds a bridge between:

* Thermodynamics (molecular states)
    
* Symbolic mathematics (orbit-based partitions)
    
* Information theory (entropy manipulation)

### 📾 Final Thoughts

This symbolic simulation framework does not attempt to replace the classical Banach–Tarski proof, but rather reframes its ideas using structured, computable logic. While non-measurable sets and the Axiom of Choice remain central to the original paradox, symbolic orbit encodings offer a promising direction for simulation, education, and new insights into group-based transformations and partitioning of space.
