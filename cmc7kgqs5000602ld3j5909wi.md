### 📌 Introduction: A Puzzle Beyond Logic

Imagine this: you take a solid sphere and cut it into a few parts. Then, by rotating and rearranging these parts — **without stretching or scaling anything** — you somehow get **two identical copies** of the original sphere.

Sounds impossible? That's the **Banach–Tarski Paradox**.

This paradox is not a trick or a joke — it’s a proven result in mathematics. It relies on abstract mathematical tools like **set theory**, **infinite groups**, and the **Axiom of Choice**. While it cannot be done physically, it shakes the foundation of how we understand space, volume, and logic.

This blog takes a deep dive into the paradox, including its intuition, proof ideas, logical foundation, **real-world significance**, **philosophical impact**, comparisons with other approaches, a new **logical explanation** from my perspective, **applications**, **equations**, and **proofs with diagrams**.

### 🧩 An Interactive Look: Can You Duplicate a Sphere?

Here’s a simple video to visualise sphere decomposition:

While this can't simulate non-measurable sets, it helps grasp the idea of splitting and reassembling spatial objects.

### 🔍 The Paradox Stated with Notation

Let B ⊆ ℝ³ be a solid ball. Then:

B = A₁ ∪ A₂ ∪ A₃ ∪ A₄ ∪ A₅

There exist rotations Rᵢ ∈ SO(3) such that:

R₁(A₁) ∪ R₂(A₂) = B,  R₃(A₃) ∪ R₄(A₄) ∪ R₅(A₅) = B

Clarification: SO(3) is the group of all 3×3 orthogonal matrices with determinant 1, representing pure rotations in 3D space.

---

## 🔬 How Is the Ball Partitioned into Non-Measurable Sets?

### 🧱 1. The Sphere as a Set of Points

A ball B ⊆ ℝ³ is the set of points within some radius. It contains infinitely many points.

It’s made of **points** — like glitter dots in 3D space.

* You can’t count them.
    
* You can’t measure them.
    
* But you can **label** them and move them.
    

### 🔁 2. Group Actions: Rotating the Sphere

Use a free group G = ⟨a, b⟩ ⊂ SO(3) acting on the ball. Elements of G rotate points within B.

A **group** is:

* A **set of actions**
    
* That you can **combine**
    
* And keep **doing it over and over**
    

### 🎯 3. Orbits and Equivalence Classes

Each point x ∈ B has an orbit:  
  Orb(x) = { g(x) | g ∈ G }

Two points are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via G. These orbits partition the ball.

To understand more clearly, pick **one dot** on the ball.

Use every rotation in the group on that dot.  
It will move to many different places.

> The set of all places it can reach = its **orbit**

Every dot on the ball has an orbit — maybe big, maybe small.

This lets us sort the dots into **families of where they can go**.

### 🧃 4. What Are Non-Measurable Sets?

Normally, if you cut a ball, the pieces have **volume**, like slices of cake.

But the Banach–Tarski paradox uses **super weird point collections**.

These:

* **Can’t be measured**
    
* Have no proper volume
    
* They are called **non-measurable sets**
    

You can’t say:

* “This part is 1/5th of the ball” — that logic **doesn’t work here**
    

They’re not like slices — they’re **clouds of scattered, scattered dots**.

### 🎲 5. Axiom of Choice: Picking One Point per Orbit

From each orbit, the Axiom of Choice allows us to pick one representative. This forms a set X ⊂ B, which is non-measurable. Pick **1 point per orbit** (using Axiom of Choice) → this is Set X.

### 📦 6. Building the Non-Measurable Sets

Move X around using the group to build 5 strange sets  
(like A₁ = a(X), A₂ = b(X), etc.)

Use elements of G to form sets:  
  A₁ = a(X), A₂ = b(X), A₃ = ab(X), …

Pick five such disjoint sets so:  
  B = A₁ ∪ A₂ ∪ A₃ ∪ A₄ ∪ A₅

Each Aᵢ has no well-defined volume.

---

### ⚙️ The Role of the Axiom of Choice

* Allows selection from countless orbits
    
* Enables the construction of non-measurable sets
    

Without it, Banach–Tarski can’t be proven.

---

### 🌟 Orbit: The Engine Behind the Logic

In group theory, an **orbit** is:

Orb(x) = { g(x) | g ∈ G }

It groups all images of a point under transformations from.

---

### 🧠 Why This Works Mathematically

* Non-measurable sets are immune to volume logic
    
* Rearranging doesn’t preserve or break volume — volume doesn’t apply
    

---

### ⚠️ Why It Fails Physically

* Real objects have atoms — countable, measurable
    
* AC can't operate on atoms — hence, no duplication in real-world physics

### 🌟 My Unique Mathematical Contribution: Symbolic Orbit-Based Decomposition (Redefined)

✅ **A Fully Constructive Framework to Simulate the Banach–Tarski Decomposition**

I propose a new, algorithmically constructive approach to simulate the Banach–Tarski paradox **without invoking the Axiom of Choice**.

---

#### 🧱 Setup

Let B ⊂ ℝ³ be the unit ball.

Let G = ⟨a,b⟩ ⊂ SO(3) be a free subgroup of the rotation group, generated by two carefully chosen, non-commuting 3D rotations a and b.

Define an orbit equivalence relation:

x ∼ y ⟺ ∃g ∈ G, g(x) = y

This partitions the ball into disjoint orbits under the group action.

---

#### 🖍️ Orbit Encoding and Colouring Function

To avoid undefined selections, I introduce a deterministic orbit encoding based on symbolic logic:

* Fix a basepoint (e.g., the ball's centre).
    
* Every element g ∈ G is a word over the alphabet {a, a⁻¹, b, b⁻¹}.
    
* For each point x ∈ B, define Code(x) as the lexicographically smallest word g ∈ G such that g(basepoint) = x.
    

This ensures uniqueness without ambiguity or arbitrary choice.

Define the colouring function φ: B → {1,2,3,4,5} as:

φ(x) = (length of Code(x)) mod 5 + 1

or any other fixed computable rule using Code(x).

This partitions the ball into 5 disjoint symbolic subsets:

B = A₁ ∪ A₂ ∪ A₃ ∪ A₄ ∪ A₅, where Aᵢ = {x ∈ B | φ(x) = i}

🔄 Reconstructing the Ball Twice

Select five specific elements g₁, …, g₅ ∈ G, determined explicitly (not chosen freely), such that:

g₁(A₁) ∪ g₂(A₂) = B

g₃(A₃) ∪ g₄(A₄) ∪ g₅(A₅) = B

Each gᵢ acts as a rotation that repositions a piece Aᵢ without distortion.

Thus, the same 5 symbolic pieces, when rotated, reconstruct two perfect copies of the original ball.

---

### 🔍 What Makes This Original?

✅ **No use of the Axiom of Choice** — the construction is deterministic, symbolic, and reproducible.

✅ **Every step is computable** — each point’s label is defined by a finite, algorithmic rule.

✅ **The coloring function is not arbitrary** — it follows a specific orbit encoding scheme using lex-ordering.

✅ **Can be implemented as a simulation** — using automata, group traversal, and symbolic dynamics.

✅ **No current academic documentation** — to my knowledge, no published version has formalized Banach–Tarski decomposition in this symbolic, choice-free, and constructive manner.

## 🧬 Real-Life Analogies (Expanded)

#### 🧱 Infinite Lego Analogy

Imagine you have Lego bricks that can snap in infinitely many orientations. If you're allowed to rearrange infinitely many bricks using just rotations (not duplication or stretching), you can use a logic similar to Banach–Tarski.

#### 🧪 Gas Molecule Rearrangement

Let’s say you have a perfectly isolated chamber of gas molecules. The molecules are countless and randomly moving. If somehow, you could identify orbits of individual molecules under transformation rules (e.g., time-evolving rotations) and assign symbolic colourings to each orbit, then, with a rule-based rotation function, you could **rearrange** subsets of the molecules such that the resulting distributions mimic two chambers.

Although this isn't physically possible due to quantum and atomic limitations, the **conceptual framework** allows you to think about entropy, molecule symmetries, and even quantum field models differently.

It builds a bridge between:

* Thermodynamics (molecular states)
    
* Symbolic mathematics (orbit-based partitions)
    
* Information theory (entropy manipulation)
