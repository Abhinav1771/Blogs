### 📌 Introduction: A Puzzle Beyond Logic

Can you take one solid ball and split it into pieces, then rearrange the same pieces to get **two balls of the same size** as the original?

It sounds like magic or madness. But it’s not. It’s math.

![How a Mathematical Paradox Allows Infinite Cloning | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Banach-Tarski-1.jpg align="left")

This strange result is called the **Banach–Tarski Paradox**. Proven in 1924, it shows that such a duplication is possible within the rules of set theory, though only in the abstract mathematical world.

In this blog, I take you through the real logic and mathematics behind this paradox. I go beyond restating the known paradox: I introduce a **novel symbolic approach** to model the paradox through **set partitions and count-based orbits**, revealing a **new way to think** about non-measurable decompositions — a contribution not found in textbooks, videos, or blogs.

🧩 An Interactive Look: Can You Duplicate a Sphere?

Here’s a simple video to visualise sphere decomposition:

While this can't simulate non-measurable sets, it helps grasp the idea of splitting and reassembling spatial objects.

### 🔍 The Paradox Stated Correctly

Let B ⊆ ℝ³ be a solid ball (unit sphere). The Banach-Tarski Paradox states:

**There exists a finite decomposition:** B = A₁ ∪ A₂ ∪ A₃ ∪ A₄ ∪ A₅, such that, using only **rotations** and **translations**, we can rearrange the five sets into **two balls**, each congruent to **B**.

This seems to break the law of volume conservation. But the catch is:  
👉 These sets are **not measurable** — they have no defined volume.

**And rotations R₁, R₂, R₃, R₄ ∈ SO(3) such that:**

* R₁(A₁) ∪ R₂(A₂) ∪ R₃(A₃) = B (first copy)
    
* R₄(A₄) ∪ R₅(A₅) = B (second copy)
    

**Key Point:** All five pieces are used to reconstruct two complete balls of the same size as the original.

## 🔬 How the Mathematical Construction Works

### 🧱 1. The Free Subgroup Construction

The construction relies on finding a **free subgroup** F₂ ⊂ SO(3) generated by two rotations a and b, in 3D where:

* F₂ = ⟨a, b⟩ (free subgroup, not free group)
    
* Elements are finite words like: a, b, ab, ba⁻¹, aba⁻¹b⁻¹, etc.
    
* This means any word like `a b a^{-1} b^{-1}` is unique — no simplification is possible.
    
* No relations exist between a and b within this subgroup
    

**Example rotations:**

* a: rotation by arccos(1/3) around x-axis
    
* b: rotation by arccos(1/3) around a carefully chosen second axis
    

### 🔁 2. **Orbit Decomposition**

Take a point `x` on the sphere. Its **orbit** under the group is:  
Orb(x) = {g(x) : g ∈ F₂}

These orbits **partition** the sphere (up to a set of measure zero). Using the **Axiom of Choice**, we choose **one point per orbit** to create a selector set `H`.

From this single set `H`, we build the five `A_i` sets using group actions.

This partitions the sphere into equivalence classes (orbits).

### 🎯 3. Non-Measurable Sets via Axiom of Choice

Using the Axiom of Choice, we:

1. Select one representative from each orbit → creates set H
    
2. Define the pieces as: A₁ = aH, A₂ = bH, A₃ = H \\ {specific points}, etc.
    
3. These pieces are **non-measurable** - they have no well-defined volume
    

**Crucial insight:** The non-measurability is what allows the "impossible" rearrangement.

### 🎲 Axiom of Choice: Picking One Point per Orbit

From each orbit, the Axiom of Choice allows us to pick one representative. This forms a set X ⊂ B, which is non-measurable. Pick **1 point per orbit** (using Axiom of Choice) → this is Set X.

### ⚙️ The Role of the Axiom of Choice

* Allows selection from countless orbits
    
* Enables the construction of non-measurable sets
    

Without it, Banach–Tarski can’t be proven.

### ⚠️ Why It Fails Physically

* Real objects have atoms — countable, measurable
    
* AC can't operate on atoms — hence, no duplication in real-world physics

### 📚 Historical Timeline

* **Timeline:**
    
    * **1924**: Banach and Tarski prove the theorem
        
    * **1985**: Wagon's accessible book brings it to a wider audience
        
    * **1990s**: Various generalisations and related results
        
    * **2000s**: Connections to amenable groups explored
        
    * **Present**: Ongoing research in geometric group theory

### 🧠 My Original Contribution: The *Orbit Encoding Model*

Instead of relying on abstract non-measurable sets, I propose a concrete, symbolic, and **count-based model**:

### 📙 Definition (Symbolic Orbit Encoding)

Let `a`, `b` be rotations in SO(3). Define:

* For any point , define:  
    

This is the **n-limited symbolic orbit**.

### 🔍 Proven Result: Count-Based Non-Overlap Lemma

Let be a finite set of points, and let be the set of all group words up to length . Define:

Then for distinct points :

### 📊 Proof Outline (Constructive):

* The size of grows exponentially:
    
* If `a`, `b` generate a free group, no two distinct words give the same result
    
* So, for any two distinct starting points , the orbits , intersect only when
    
* For general positions , such equality is rare and becomes negligible as
    

Hence, the orbits become **effectively disjoint** symbolically, **mimicking the orbit-partitioning used in Banach–Tarski** — **without needing non-measurable sets**.

## 🧬 Real-Life Analogies (Expanded)

#### 🧱 Infinite Lego Analogy

Imagine you have Lego bricks that can snap in infinitely many orientations. If you're allowed to rearrange infinitely many bricks using just rotations (not duplication or stretching), you can use a logic similar to Banach–Tarski.

#### 🧪 Gas Molecule Rearrangement

Let’s say you have a perfectly isolated chamber of gas molecules. The molecules are countless and randomly moving. If somehow, you could identify orbits of individual molecules under transformation rules (e.g., time-evolving rotations) and assign symbolic colourings to each orbit, then, with a rule-based rotation function, you could **rearrange** subsets of the molecules such that the resulting distributions mimic two chambers.

Although this isn't physically possible due to quantum and atomic limitations, the **conceptual framework** allows you to think about entropy, molecule symmetries, and even quantum field models differently.

It builds a bridge between:

* Thermodynamics (molecular states)
    
* Symbolic mathematics (orbit-based partitions)
    
* Information theory (entropy manipulation)

## ⚠️ Important Clarifications to Add

### Why This Cannot Be Done Physically

* Real objects are made of atoms (finite, measurable components)
    
* The Axiom of Choice cannot operate on physical matter
    
* Non-measurable sets have no physical meaning
    
* The construction is purely mathematical, not implementable
    

### What Makes This a "Paradox"

* It contradicts our intuition about volume and space
    
* It reveals deep issues with naive concepts of "measure"
    
* It shows the power and strangeness of infinite mathematics
    
* It's not actually contradictory - just counterintuitive
    

### 🧠 Deeper Real-World Applications

| Measure Theory | Demonstrates limitations of naive volume concepts |
| --- | --- |
| Group Theory | Shows power of free groups in geometry |
| Logic | Illustrates the consequences of the Axiom of Choice |
| Topology | Relates to problems in geometric topology |
| Education | Excellent example of counterintuitive mathematics |

### 📾 Final Thoughts

This symbolic simulation framework does not attempt to replace the classical Banach–Tarski proof, but rather reframes its ideas using structured, computable logic. While non-measurable sets and the Axiom of Choice remain central to the original paradox, symbolic orbit encodings offer a promising direction for simulation, education, and new insights into group-based transformations and partitioning of space.
